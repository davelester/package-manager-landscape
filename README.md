# Package Manager Landscape

This project looks to organize the ecosystem of software package managers in a visual form.

It's inspired by the [CNCF Landscape](http://landscape.cncf.io) and many other software and memberships the Linux Foundation has published at [landscapes.dev](https://landscapes.dev).
